In Django, there are three main ways to create and manage forms. Each approach has its own use case depending on the complexity and requirements of your project:

1. Django Forms (Built-in Form Classes)
What is it? Django provides a forms module to create form classes. You define your form fields in Python, and Django generates the HTML for you.

When to use?

When you need to create a form that is not directly tied to a database model (e.g., contact forms, search forms, feedback forms).
For forms with custom validation or fields that don't map directly to database fields.
Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from django import forms

class ContactForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = forms.EmailField()
    message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)

    def clean_email(self):
        email = self.cleaned_data.get('email')
        if not email.endswith("@example.com"):
            raise forms.ValidationError("Email must end with @example.com")
        return email
How to render in a template:

html
Copy
Edit
<form method="post">
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
2. Model Forms
What is it? A ModelForm is a subclass of forms.Form that is directly linked to a database model. It automates the creation of form fields based on the model fields.

When to use?

When you need a form to create or update database records.
Reduces boilerplate code since fields are auto-generated from the model.
Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from django import forms
from .models import Product

class ProductForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Product
        fields = ['name', 'price', 'description']
How to render in a template:

html
Copy
Edit
<form method="post">
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
3. Formsets
What is it? A formset is a collection of Django forms that allows you to manage multiple forms on a single page.

When to use?

When you need to handle multiple forms of the same type (e.g., adding multiple items to a list).
For batch operations, like creating or updating multiple objects at once.
Types of Formsets:

Basic Formsets: General formsets without a model.
Model Formsets: Formsets tied to a model, useful for bulk creation or editing.
Inline Formsets: A specialized formset for managing related models (e.g., child models in a ForeignKey or OneToOneField relationship).
Example:

python
Copy
Edit
from django.forms import formset_factory

class OrderForm(forms.Form):
    item = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    quantity = forms.IntegerField(min_value=1)

OrderFormSet = formset_factory(OrderForm, extra=3)
How to render in a template:

html
Copy
Edit
<form method="post">
    {{ formset.management_form }}
    {% for form in formset %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
    {% endfor %}
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
When to Choose What?
Use Case	Recommended Form Type
Custom forms not tied to the database	Django Forms
Create/update records in the database	Model Forms
Handle multiple forms of the same type	Formsets
Manage parent-child relationships	Inline Formsets
Forms with advanced validation logic	Django Forms or Model Forms with custom validation logic
